# Share on Mastodon add-on for (IndieBlocks) notes

Have Share on Mastodon recognize IndieBlocks notes, and ...

- Crosspost (brief enough) notes in full.
- Correctly thread "replies-to-self."
- Convert HTML (such as `<strong>HTML</strong>`) to Markdown (i.e., `**HTML**`).
- Append tags, if any, and a perma(short)link.

Posts with a type other than `indieblocks_note` will be ignored (i.e., they will behave and be shared as before).
